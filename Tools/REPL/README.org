#+TITLE: Python2.2 REPL for Echelon: Wind Warrior

This is little REPL for game internals exploration.

** Installation
   Copy =.py= files into =/Modules= directory where game is installed.
   Add to =/Modules/Menu15/Main.py= somewhere near file's end:
   #+begin_src python
     import REPL
     REPL.main()
   #+end_src

   Run python22 within =/Modules= directory and type:
   #+begin_src python
     import replmd
     replmd.main()
   #+end_src

** Development
   Please don't.

   Ok, I'm joking. I developed those files inside =C:/python22/Lib/site-packages= to make them
   available to interpreter and don't want bother improving this process for now.
